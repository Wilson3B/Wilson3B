Hi, Iâ€™m Wilson! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

I'm currently a graduate student studying Computer Science at University of Southern California. Before this, I earned my B.S in Cognitive Science with specialization in machine learning and neural computation from UC San Diego.

My interests focus on building embodied AI systems that can perceive and interact with the world autonomously using machine learning and multimodal learning. Iâ€™m also interested in studying these agents to explore questions about human cognition.
